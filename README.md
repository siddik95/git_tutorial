## Version control with Git and GitHub
Version control is a process that tracks changes made to any file or program to fix a bug or make continuous improvements. Version control is done locally with git with a local repository, while a remote repository is hosted online in GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
### Git installation
The installation of Git is fairly straightforward. Go to [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), then download and install the version suitable for your operating system.
### Creating a profile in GitHub
You can create a profile on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. GitHub is the most popular one. While GitHub is not open-source, GitLab and Bitbucket are. I prefer GitHub, but you are open to choosing any of them. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create an account.
